# OGP

## Overview

The objective of Old Games Plus is to work our way through the winners of Golden Joystick's Game Of The Year awards and replicate the functionality of a singular "level". Obviously the format of games will vary with each winner so the interpretation of "level" and thus our self-imposed restrictions/objectives will vary per iteration.

For each game we will attempt to: 

- Create a new "level"
- Add a new mechanic
- Create a new asset
